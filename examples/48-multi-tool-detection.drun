# Example 48: Multi-Tool Detection with Comma-Separated Lists
# ====================================================================
#
# This example demonstrates checking multiple tools in a single
# "is available" or "is not available" statement.
#
# Logic:
# - For "is available": ALL tools must be available (AND logic)
# - For "is not available": ANY tool is unavailable (OR logic)
